"""Qlik object type -> Power BI visual, with an honest substitution note.

Three outcomes per visual:

  native       a direct equivalent exists; nothing to report
  substituted  no exact match, but a close native visual carries the intent —
               emitted, with a note saying what changed
  manual       nothing native reproduces it; a placeholder is emitted and the
               note explains what to install or rebuild

Nothing here calls a model. The mapping is a lookup table plus a small amount
of shape logic, so the same input always produces the same output.
