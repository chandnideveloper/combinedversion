"""Cache a generated package (the flat {relative_path: content} dict) keyed
by run_id, so `/download` can hand back the exact files `/generate` already
built without re-running generation.

Two layers:
  - an in-process dict, always available, always fast;
  - a best-effort remote copy on the same MongoDB microservice `/generate`
    already talks to (app.sources.mapping_client), so the cache survives a
    process restart or a second instance behind a load balancer.

The remote layer degrades silently: if the microservice has no
`generation-package` collection yet (a 404, or the endpoint doesn't exist),
`save`/`load` simply fall back to memory-only rather than raising - a cache
miss just means `/download` re-runs generation, which is always correct,
only slower.
