"""Upload a Qlik CSV/file-based table's real content into a Fabric Lakehouse.

Every file-based table's M-query previously pointed at a fixed external
Supabase Storage bucket (see app/model/table_tmdl.py's SUPABASE_STORAGE_URL) -
a hardcoded stand-in with no upload step of its own anywhere in this
pipeline. If the exact filename hadn't already been staged there by some
other, unrelated process, the report's visuals would fail to resolve their
fields at refresh time ("something's wrong with one or more fields").

This module does the two things that stand-in was never actually backed by:
ensure a Lakehouse exists in the target Fabric workspace, and upload each
data file's real bytes into it via OneLake's ADLS Gen2-compatible REST API
(create -> append -> flush), so a real Fabric-hosted copy exists that the
M-query can be rewritten to point at instead.

Note: this talks to two live Microsoft Fabric REST surfaces (the Fabric
items API and the OneLake DFS API) that cannot be exercised against a real
tenant in this environment - the request/response shapes here follow
Microsoft's published OneLake/Fabric REST API documentation and are covered
by mocked unit tests, but a live smoke test against a real workspace is
recommended before depending on this in production.
